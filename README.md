# Top_3%-Kaggle-Digit-Recognizer
Code for the "Digit-Recognizer" competition on Kaggle.

Objective: correctly identify digits (0-9) from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

You can learn from this code how to:

1. Preprocess decoded images (normalization, label encoding, reshaping).
2. Augment the data (create new images from existing ones by rotating, zooming and shifting).
3. Build an ensemble of Neural Nets.
4. Train Neural Nets with decreasing learning rate.
